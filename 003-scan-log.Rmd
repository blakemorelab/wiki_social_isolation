### Pilot 02

-   Practice run didn't work. Participant pressed "1" many times before understanding task - so that might have caused it to glitch. Therefore, scan runs won't be "pre-calibrated" to participant reaction time.
-   Projector glitched a double image during one run of the task
-   Participant said feedback is too fast
-   Anatomical scan was run twice due to participant movement
-   Functional scans were run several times - due to initial issue with trigger - therefore the final four functional scans are the correct scans
