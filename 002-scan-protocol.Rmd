### Practice Task Instructions

-   Explain task

> In this task, you are playing for real money! Your goal is to make as much money as possible! Each trial will begin with a cross. You will then see a star with a number inside. The number inside the star indicates how much money you can earn or lose on each trial. After each star you will see a white circle - followed by a white square. Your job is to respond to the white square by pressing the button as quickly as possible.

> If you press the button quick enough on a win trial, you will win the amount in the star. If you press the button quick enough on a lose trial, you will avoid losing the amount in the star. There are also some trials where you don't win or lose any money (0 pounds in the star). These are to make sure you are paying attention, so even though you won't win or lose any money on these trials be sure to press as fast as you can anyway. At the end of the game, the computer randomly picks out some of your trials for a real payment (up to 5 pounds) - so be sure to pay close attention and press the button as quickly as you can when you see the white square to earn as much as possible.
